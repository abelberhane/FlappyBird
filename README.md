# FlappyBird
First attempt at Flappy Bird. Lots of great resources online to help support this project. 

There were some struggles and I had to research a few pieces of deprecated code. I do need to work on styling the labels when they are shown 
as well as the score. Considering moving it down below. The Final counter is off as well and noted for the next release.
