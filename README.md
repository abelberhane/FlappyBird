# Flappy Bird
First attempt at Flappy Bird. Lots of great resources online to help support this project. Developing this was interesting as every
resource I came across had similar ideas but went about it in different ways. I found the spacebar pressing interesting and it 
simulated the traditional phone tapping to keep the character afloat. There were some struggles and I had to research a few pieces of deprecated code. 

I just went back and re-did the labels to show a bit better and accurately display the Final Score. Considering moving it down below. 
But I like where it is for now and its better aligned after my most recent changes. Everything is working as expected now and I am a bit
happier. While testing it I did find a bug that allowed my character to float above the screen and I can keep pressing the space bar with no pipes in the way but accrue points. Eventually when I drop, if I do not hit a pipe I can keep playing with the score from above. I 
will have to take a look at that next time. 

### Updates/Things to Enhance
- 1) Block character from floating above the screen borders
- 2) Add a Restart button
