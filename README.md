I was always fond of Flappy Bird when it was initially released. I thought it would be really exciting to learn to code while also creating something I am very familiar with. 
Lots of great resources online to help support this project. Developing this was interesting as every
resource I came across had similar ideas but went about it in different ways. I found the spacebar pressing interesting and it 
simulated the traditional phone tapping to keep the character afloat. There were some struggles and I had to research a few pieces of deprecated code. 

I just went back and re-did the labels to show a bit better and accurately display the Final Score. Considering moving it down below. 
But I like where it is for now and its better aligned after my most recent changes. Everything is working as expected now and I am a bit
happier. While testing it I did find a bug that allowed my character to float above the screen and I can keep pressing the space bar with no pipes in the way but accrue points. Eventually when I drop, if I do not hit a pipe I can keep playing with the score from above. I will have to take a look at that next time. 

**NOTE** - This project was written many years ago. Hopefully soon I will pick it back up or make some changes. Do not be surprised if there is depricated code.

## Areas of Focus:
1) C# - I don't often use C# but this was a great exercise at the time that provided some fun exposure to it.
2) Documentation/markdown - I will also work on my markdown, formatting and presentation of my ideas in this repo.
3) Working with a GUI - Often I am scripting for a CI/CD tool and it utilizes bash, so leveraging a GUI was exciting to me.
